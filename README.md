## Dimond Price Predictor
--->The purpose of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.
--->We collected data on diamond characteristics such as carat weight, cut, color, and clarity, and used machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model. 
---->Our results show that our model is able to predict diamond prices with a high degree of accuracy. This project has significant practical applications, as it could be used by jewelers, diamond traders, and consumers to make informed decisions about buying and selling diamonds. 
---->Our diamond price predictor has the potential to save time, reduce costs, and increase transparency in the diamond market.
