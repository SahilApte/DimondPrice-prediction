# Gem Stone Price Predictor

The purpose of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.

We collected data on diamond characteristics such as carat weight, cut, color, and clarity, and used machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model.

Our results show that our model is able to predict diamond prices with a high degree of accuracy. This project has significant practical applications, as it could be used by jewelers, diamond traders, and consumers to make informed decisions about buying and selling diamonds.

Our diamond price predictor has the potential to save time, reduce costs, and increase transparency in the diamond market.
